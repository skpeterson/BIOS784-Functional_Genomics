## Project Motivation

Our project is motivated by "Epigenetic dysregulation in Alzheimerâ€™s disease peripheral immunity" (2024, Ramakrishnan).  This study investigates the transcriptional changes in the peripheral immune system in Alzheimer's disease, using advanced single-cell sequencing techniques such as ATAC-seq and RNA sequencing. 

In the investigation, the researchers include a list of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the DEG sites, their associated log 2 fold change, and overlaps between these DEGs and differentially accessible regions (DARs). While they provide overlaps between the DARs and DEGs, they do not give any further information. It could be potentially biologically interesting to know the distance and direction between the DEG and the nearest gene in the DAR. A primary goal of our investigation is to verify the study's binary overlap results and quantify the distance to and direction from the nearest gene where the overlap occurs. The researchers have also annotated, albeit in a very elementary manner, the DEGs' cell type, as well as the type of the nearest gene. We can also look for trends between gene and cell type and distance to the nearest gene.
