## Project Motivation

Our project is motivated by "Epigenetic dysregulation in Alzheimerâ€™s disease peripheral immunity" (2024, Ramakrishnan).  This study investigates the transcriptional changes in the peripheral immune system in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using advanced single-cell sequencing techniques such as scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. Ramakrishnan and his team found a considerable amount of open chromatin in the peripheral immune cells in AD relative to health controls (HC). They also identified differentially accessible chromatin regions in AD risk genes by checking the overlap between differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible regions for AD and HC.

In the investigation, the researchers include a list of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with AD, their associated log 2 fold change, and overlaps between these DEGs and differentially accessible regions (DARs). While they provide overlaps between the DARs and DEGs, they do not give any further information. In our analysis we investigate the distance between DEGs and DARs. A primary goal of our investigation is to verify the study's binary overlap results and quantify the distance to and direction from the nearest gene where the overlap occurs. The researchers have also annotated, albeit in a very elementary manner, the DEGs' cell type, as well as the type of the nearest gene. We can also look for trends between gene and cell type and distance to the nearest gene, which can further elaborate on the findings of this study.

## Methods

The study began by providing information on DARs and DEGs. Using the DEG names they provided, we annotated the gene coordinates that correspond with the gene using the `EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86` library. Using the two GRanges objects containing the DARs and DEGs, we were interested in quantifying the overlap DARs and DEGs. We are particularly interested in the promoter regions of the DEGs and we can extract those from our GRanges object using the promoters() function. Given that chromatin should be accessible at promoters for DEGs, whether promoter regions of DEGs overlap DARs should serve as a positive control.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Define promoter regions for DEGs (e.g., 2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream of the TSS)
degs_promoters <- promoters(degs_gr, upstream = 2000, downstream = 500)
```

We also grouped DEGs and DARs by cell type to determine cell-type specific associations between DEGs and DARs. We calculated distance between DEG promoters and DARs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cell_types <- intersect(unique(degs_gr$cell_type), unique(dars_gr$cell_type))

# Step 1: Initialize lists to store results by cell type
results_by_cell_type <- list()
dars_with_distances_and_metadata_by_cell_type <- list()

# Step 2: Loop over each cell type and compute necessary steps
for (ct in cell_types) {
  
  # Subset DEGs promoters and DARs for the current cell type
  degs_subset <- degs_promoters[degs_promoters$cell_type == ct]
  dars_subset <- dars_gr[dars_gr$cell_type == ct]
  
  # Check if both subsets are non-empty to avoid errors
  if (length(degs_subset) == 0 || length(dars_subset) == 0) {
    warning(paste("Skipping cell type", ct, "due to empty DEGs or DARs."))
    next
  }

Ramakrishnan et al. identified 217* overlaps, 38 of which were located within promoter regions of DEGs. We identified 29358 DARs with a distance of 0 from DEG promoter regions (2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream of the TSS). Of our 29358 DARs overlapping DEGs, only 40 were recorded as overlaps by Ramakrishnan et al., whereas 29318 were not.

- Distances don't overlap with their DAR/DEG variable. TRUE/FALSE vs distances. Results aren't consistent, but they only have a binary variable for us to compare results to

-we are looking at closest DEG compared to them finding the nearest gene --> important to look at nearest DEG for more biological relevance.
