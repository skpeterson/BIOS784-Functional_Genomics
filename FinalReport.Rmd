## Project Motivation and Background

This project builds on insights from "Epigenetic Dysregulation in Alzheimer’s Disease Peripheral Immunity" (2024, Ramakrishnan), which utilized single cell assays of transposable accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes in the peripheral immune systems of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). 

While some immune cells, such as microglia, have been investigated for their role in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s, the role of the peripheral immune cells has not been investigated in much depth. Learning more about these cells can potentially increase our understanding of disease etiology and pathogenesis.

The study identified significant increases in chromatin accessibility in peripheral immune cells of AD patients, with a focus on the APOE gene (Apolipoprotein E), a key risk gene for AD with three isoforms: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. The APOE protein is involved in the transportation of lipids throughout the cell. Although it’s not entirely clear how APOE contributes to Alzheimer’s disease, it is thought to influence amyloid beta metabolism and immune function. Investigating differential expression of immune cells associated with these isoforms may provide insight into the role of APOE in AD. APOE could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of AD.

The authors provided a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), their log2 fold changes, and overlaps between DEGs and differentially accessible regions (DARs).

Single-cell multiomic (multiple biological measurements from the same cell) analyses, particularly those utilizing scATAC-seq, remain a field without standard data processing pipelines and steps. Thus, these data present a unique opportunity to learn exploratory analysis techniques for linking chromatin state to transcriptional activity in immune cells at single-cell resolution.

Our study extends the scope of Ramakrishnan et al. by systematically quantifying the spatial relationship between DARs and DEGs across all immune cell types. Specifically, we aim to expand upon the reported binary overlap results by measuring distances between DARs and the nearest DEG promoters. Additionally, we explore correlations between gene regulation patterns and cell types to identify potential trends linking DAR proximity, gene type, and immune cell identity.

## Data Analysis Methods

### Data Preparation 

We started with the processed DAR and DEG datasets provided in the original study. Using the DEG names, we retrieved the corresponding genomic coordinates by leveraging the EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86 library for gene annotations.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
# pull out genes from provided processed DEGs
features <- degs_filter$feature

# Load EnsDb and filter gene coordinates
edb <- EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86
g <- genes(edb)
g <- keepStandardChromosomes(g, pruning.mode = 'coarse') # standard chromosomes
```

We then utilized `GenomicRanges` library and constructed GRanges objects for both DARs and DEGs. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create DARs GRanges object
dars_gr <- GRanges(seqnames = dars_chr, 
                   ranges = IRanges(start = dars_start, end = dars_end),
                   strand = "*")

# Create DEG GRanges object
degs_gr <- GRanges(
  seqnames = paste0('chr', degs_coords_mapped$seqnames),  # correct format for seqnames
  ranges = IRanges(start = degs_coords_mapped$start, end = degs_coords_mapped$end),
  strand = "*"  # placeholder bc strand not relevant 
)
```

### Promoter Regions

To focus on regulatory activity at promoters, we defined promoter regions for DEGs as 2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Chromatin accessibility at these regions is critical for gene regulation, making them a logical focus for overlap analysis with DARs. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Define promoter regions for DEGs (e.g., 2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream of the TSS)
degs_promoters <- promoters(degs_gr, upstream = 2000, downstream = 500)
```

### Quantifying Overlaps

Next, we calculated the number of DARs overlapping DEG promoter regions. This step serves as a positive control, as accessible chromatin at DEG promoters is expected. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Calculate overlaps between DARs and DEG promoters
overlaps <- findOverlaps(dars_gr, degs_promoters)
```

### Distance Analysis

Beyond overlap counts, we assessed the spatial relationship between DARs and DEGs by measuring the distance between each DAR and its nearest DEG promoter. This provides a quantitative measure of proximity, by calculating the basepair distance between the two. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Calculate distance to the nearest DEG promoter for each DAR
dist_to_nearest <- distanceToNearest(dars_gr, degs_promoters)
```

## Results and Discussion 

### Summary of Provided Processed Data 

Ramakrishnan et al. identified approximately 140,000 DARs and 75,000 DEGs across multiple immune cell types, representing unique, cell type–specific expression patterns. By applying an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05 and a log2 fold-change cutoff of > |0.125|, they filtered their dataset to ~9,200 DARs and ~3,400 DEGs. In response, we filtered the dataset with this p-value threshold as well.

### Distance Analysis

#### Comparison to Paper Results 

Briefly summarizing the data as provided by the paper, we can see the authors identified 68 overlaps with DARs and DEGs, with monocytes having the highest number among the cell types. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## read in data 
dars_all <- read.csv('source_data/TableS2_DAR_between_AD_HC.txt',sep = '\t')
degs_all <- read.csv('source_data/TableS3_DEG_between_AD_HC.txt', sep = '\t')

## filter data by p-value and log2fc cut offs for significant data 
dars_all <- dars_all %>% 
  filter(LR_padj < 0.05) %>% 
  filter(avg_log2FC > 0.125 | avg_log2FC < -0.125)


degs_all <- degs_all %>% 
  filter(MAST_padj < 0.05) %>% 
  filter(avg_log2FC > 0.125 | avg_log2FC < -0.125)

degs_all$cell_type <- sapply(degs_all$cell_type, function(x) {
  if (x %in% c("B_intermediate", "B_memory", "B_naive", "Plasmablast")) {
    return("B_Cells")
  } else if (x %in% c("CD14_Mono", "CD16_Mono")) {
    return("Monocytes")
  } else if (x %in% c("ASDC", "cDC1", "cDC2", "pDC")) {
    return("Dendritic_Cells")
  } else if (x %in% c("CD4_CTL", "CD4_Naive", "CD4_Proliferating", "CD4_TCM", "CD4_TEM", "Treg")) {

  } else if (x %in% c("Platelet", "Eryth", "HSPC", "Doublet")) {

  } else {
    return(x) # Return the original value if no match is found
  }
})

summary_overlaps <- degs_all %>% group_by(cell_type,DAR_DEG_overlap) %>% tally()

summary_overlaps %>%
  kable(caption = "Counts of DAR-DEG Overlaps by Cell Type",
    col.names = c("Cell Type", "DAR-DEG Overlap", "Count"))
```

Looking at our data, we identified 158 overlaps between DEGs and DARs, with CD 8+ T Cells having the highest. Provided that the data as downloaded did not have the ranges of the genes, it is possible that the difference is due to how we handled our promoter regions which accounts for the difference between our results and the paper results. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dars_with_distances_and_metadata <- read.csv("working_data/dars_with_distances_and_metadata.csv")
cell_type_overlaps <- dars_with_distances_and_metadata %>% group_by(cell_type_dar, DAR_deg_overlap) %>% tally()

cell_type_overlaps %>%
  kable(caption = "Counts of DAR-DEG Overlaps by Cell Type",
    col.names = c("Cell Type", "DAR-DEG Overlap", "Count"))
```
Ramakrishnan et al. provide TRUE/FALSE as the read out for DAR and DEG overlap. To compare out calculated distances to their results, we look at how often our calculated value of 0 matches their value of 'True'. We find that while the results are not, we confirmed use of the same reference genome (hg38) for annotating genes

```{r, echo = FALSE}
read.csv("figures/distance_overlap_check.csv") %>%
  kable(caption = "Distance to nearest DEG compared to Published Overlap")
```

One additional comparison is to look at how often the DAR is overlapping more than one DEG. By counting the number of overlaps and plotting this as a histogram, we can see that while the majority of our DARs overlap with 0 DEGs as we noted previously, we can see that we do have DARs that overlap with up to 15 DEGs. It is possible that the location of a high number of overlaps is occurring is gene rich portions in the genome, such the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Located on chr6, the MHC is densely populated with genes that that play a key role in regulating the immune system, and these genes typically have higher accesssibility in immune cell populations.

![Frequency of number of DEGs overlapping a a single DAR](~/BIOS784-Functional_Genomics/figures/hist_freq_num_overlaps_per_DAR_DEG.png)

One additional thought, while this considers DAR and DEG overlap, perhaps the initial overlap comparison would make more sense if done between DARs and all genes, as opposed to only differentially expressed genes. The processed data as provided by the authors includes only the log2FC values between disease/healthy individuals, so we are unable to explore expression of all genes. 


#### Stratified by Cell Type

To assess whether the relationship between DARs and DEGs varies by immune cell type, we analyzed the distances between DARs and their nearest DEGs, stratified by cell type. Our results indicate that cell type does not appear to influence these distances—the distances were relatively consistent across all immune cell types. This suggests that regulatory elements (DARs) are equally distant from their associated genes across different cell types.

![Distance to Nearest DEG by Cell Type](~/BIOS784-Functional_Genomics/figures/dist_by_celltype_plot.png)

#### Stratified by Gene Type

Next, we examined the distances between DARs and DEGs stratified by gene biotype (e.g., protein-coding genes, lncRNAs, pseudogenes). The results reveal that while protein-coding genes predominate, other gene types exhibit variable distances to DARs. This variation suggests potential differences in regulatory mechanisms or constraints depending on the biotype of the DEG.

![Distance to Nearest DEG by Gene Biotype](~/BIOS784-Functional_Genomics/figures/dist_by_biotype_plot.png)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
read.csv("figures/distance_less100_overlap_check.csv") %>%
  kable(caption = "Distance Overlap of <100 bp Compared to Published Overlap")
```


### Correlations between DAR and DEG Log2FC

To assess whether DARs and DEGs exhibit correlated transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes, we calculated the correlation between their log2 fold-changes. The correlation coefficient was 0.055, indicating no strong linear relationship between DAR and DEG activity. Literature suggests that these should be more highly correlated, so this result is surprising to us. We aren't quite sure why the correlation is so low. 

### Accessibility and Expression Sign Consistency

We examined whether DAR and DEG log2 fold-changes share the same sign (i.e., both upregulated or both downregulated). While sign consistency was not universal, a  portion of DAR-DEG pairs demonstrated matching signs, suggesting coordinated regulatory changes in certain cases. In general, increased chromatin accessibility is associated with higher gene expression, as open chromatin provides easier access for transcriptional machinery. However, this relationship is not absolute. Transcription factors (TFs) and other regulatory proteins can modulate gene expression independently of accessibility, with some TFs repressing transcription even in accessible regions, or activating transcription by binding to closed chromatin regions and promoting chromatin remodeling.

## Project Motivation and Background

Our project is motivated by "Epigenetic dysregulation in Alzheimer’s disease peripheral immunity" (2024, Ramakrishnan).  This study investigates the transcriptional changes in the peripheral immune system in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using advanced single-cell sequencing techniques such as scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. Ramakrishnan and his team found a considerable amount of open chromatin in the peripheral immune cells in AD relative to health controls (HC). They also identified differentially accessible chromatin regions in AD risk genes by checking the overlap between differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible regions for AD and HC.

In the investigation, the researchers include a list of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with AD, their associated log 2 fold change, and overlaps between these DEGs and differentially accessible regions (DARs). While they provide overlaps between the DARs and DEGs, they do not give any further information. In our analysis we investigate the distance between DEGs and DARs. A primary goal of our investigation is to verify the study's binary overlap results and quantify the distance to and direction from the nearest gene where the overlap occurs. The researchers have also annotated, albeit in a very elementary manner, the DEGs' cell type, as well as the type of the nearest gene. We can also look for trends between gene and cell type and distance to the nearest gene, which can further elaborate on the findings of this study.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

dars_gr <- GRanges(seqnames = dars_chr, 
                   ranges = IRanges(start = dars_start, end = dars_end),
                   strand = "*")

# Create DEG GRanges object

  ranges = IRanges(start = degs_coords_mapped$start, end = degs_coords_mapped$end),
  strand = "*"  # placeholder bc strand not relevant 
)
```

### Promoter Regions

To focus on regulatory activity at promoters, we defined promoter regions for DEGs as 2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Chromatin accessibility at these regions is critical for gene regulation, making them a logical focus for overlap analysis with DARs. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Define promoter regions for DEGs (e.g., 2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream of the TSS)
degs_promoters <- promoters(degs_gr, upstream = 2000, downstream = 500)
```

### Quantifying Overlaps

Next, we calculated the number of DARs overlapping DEG promoter regions. This step serves as a positive control, as accessible chromatin at DEG promoters is expected. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Calculate overlaps between DARs and DEG promoters
overlaps <- findOverlaps(dars_gr, degs_promoters)
```
